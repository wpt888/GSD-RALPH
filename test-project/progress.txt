# GSD-RALPH Progress Log
# Learnings accumulate here across iterations

## Iteration 1 - 2026-02-06
- Phase: 1 (Hello World)
- Action: Planned phase 1 - researched, created plan, verified with plan checker
- Files changed: .planning/phases/01-hello-world/01-RESEARCH.md, .planning/phases/01-hello-world/01-01-PLAN.md, .planning/STATE.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md
- Decisions made: Single plan for both files (utils.js + index.js) since they're tightly coupled; CommonJS exports pattern per research
- Learnings: Phase is simple - 1 plan, 1 wave, 2 tasks. Research/planning/verification all passed cleanly.
- Status: completed

## Iteration 2 - 2026-02-06
- Phase: 1 (Hello World)
- Action: Executed phase 1 plans and verified goal achievement
- Files changed: utils.js, index.js, .planning/phases/01-hello-world/01-01-SUMMARY.md, .planning/phases/01-hello-world/01-VERIFICATION.md, .planning/ROADMAP.md, .planning/STATE.md
- Decisions made: Used sonnet model for executor and verifier (balanced profile)
- Learnings: Execution was clean - 2 tasks, 3 commits. Verification passed 5/5 must-haves. This is the only phase in v1.0 so milestone is complete.
- Status: completed
