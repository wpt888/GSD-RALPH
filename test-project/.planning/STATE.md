## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-hello-world | Use exports.greet shorthand pattern | Avoid mixing export patterns, maintain consistency |
| 01-hello-world | Include .js extension in require statements | Clarity and explicitness per research recommendations |

### Key Patterns
- CommonJS exports pattern: `exports.functionName = (params) => { ... }`
- Entry point pattern: index.js as main application file
- Include .js extension in require('./utils.js') statements
